## 💡 About the Project

WISH is a personal and heartfelt web-based surprise created to celebrate loved ones’ birthdays in a memorable and digital way.  
It includes letters, memories, and videos dedicated to each person, along with musical animations and personalized content — all crafted using simple frontend technologies.

⚠️ Currently, this version is built only for a few special people.  
But I’m actively working on to turning this into a complete WISH Web App –  
where anyone can create and customize birthday websites, gift pages, and templates for their favorite people.  

Stay tuned for more updates – this is just the beginning! ✨
